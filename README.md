#Motivation

Picking apples is a difficult grasping task that requires specific grasping points and motions to perform well. The best way to pick an apple is to twist it off 
so as to not hurt the tree where the apple connects. To pick apples requires a robot that can locate the apple, move a gripper to it, grab the apple firmly without
damaging it and perform this complex action. The hand and sensors we use here are designed to perform the firm grasp portion of this problem.
